## 🌟 **Pro Tips for Enhanced Testing**

### **Performance Optimization**
- Use `npm run cypress:dish-form` during active development (fastest)
- Use `npm run test:e2e:dish-form` before committing (comprehensive)
- Use `npm run playwright:dish-form` for cross-browser validation
- Use `npm run test:e2e:dish-form:live` for live environment testing
- Use `composer run test:openapi:quick` for rapid OpenAPI validation
- Reserve `./run-tests.sh extreme` for release validation

### **Debugging Form Issues**
```bash
# Visual debugging
npm run cypress:open               # See forms in real-time
npm run playwright:dish-form:headed # Watch cross-browser behavior
npm run playwright:dish-form:ui    # Modern debugging interface

# Specific component debugging
npm run cypress:dish-form           # Debug dish form workflow only
npm run cypress:dmn-api             # Debug DMN API integration only
npm run playwright:dish-form:debug  # Step-by-step dish form debugging

# ✨ OpenAPI debugging
composer run test:openapi:verbose  # Detailed OpenAPI output
composer run test:engine-info      # Engine connectivity debugging
composer run test:security:verbose # Detailed security testing

# Verbose output for specific components
composer run test:api:verbose      # Detailed API validation
npm run playwright:debug           # Step-by-step debugging all tests
npm run playwright:specific-test   # Debug specific test line
```

### **✨ OpenAPI Testing Best Practices**
```bash
# Start with essential endpoints
composer run test:engine-info      # Always test engine connectivity first
composer run test:decision-eval    # Validate core DMN evaluation

# Validate data types systematically
composer run test:string-types     # Test string variables
composer run test:integer-types    # Test integer variables
composer run test:boolean-types    # Test boolean variables

# Security validation workflow
composer run test:sql-attacks      # SQL injection protection
composer run test:xss-attacks      # XSS prevention
composer run test:json-attacks     # JSON injection prevention

# Performance monitoring
composer run test:response-times   # Response time validation
composer run test:throughput       # Request throughput testing
```

### **Environment Configuration**
```bash
# Set environment variables for different targets
export DMN_TEST_URL="https://your-test-site.com"
export DMN_API_KEY="your-api-key"
export TEST_ENV="development"  # or staging, production
export OPENAPI_SPEC_URL="https://your-openapi-spec.json"

# For live testing
npm run cypress:live               # Uses configured live URL

# ✨ For OpenAPI testing
export OPENAPI_VALIDATION=true    # Enable OpenAPI validation
export OPENAPI_SECURITY_SCAN=true # Enable security scanning
```

### **Enhanced Testing Best Practices**
- **Cypress for development**: Fast feedback, visual debugging (`npm run cypress:dish-form`)
- **Playwright for CI/CD**: Cross-browser reliability (`npm run playwright:dish-form`)
- **Both for releases**: Maximum confidence (`npm run test:e2e:dish-form`)
- **OpenAPI for API validation**: Complete endpoint coverage (`composer run test:openapi`)
- **Live testing**: Always test against real environment before deployment (`npm run test:e2e:dish-form:live`)
- **Specific testing**: Use targeted commands for faster feedback (`npm run cypress:dmn-api`)
- **Visual debugging**: Use headed modes to see form interactions (`npm run playwright:dish-form:headed`)
- **Security first**: Always validate security before release (`composer run test:security:full`)
