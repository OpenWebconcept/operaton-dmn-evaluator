## ðŸŽ¯ **Recommended Daily Workflow**

### **Morning Setup**
```bash
# Quick health check
npm run test:health
composer run hooks:status

# If working on new features
./run-tests.sh quick
```

### **During Development**

# After each significant change
composer run dev                    # Quick PHP validation
npm run dev                         # Quick E2E validation
```

### **Before Committing**
```bash
# Pre-commit validation (automatic if hooks enabled)
composer run pre-commit
git commit -m "feat: your changes"
```

### **End of Day**
```bash
# Comprehensive validation
./run-tests.sh standard
composer run check
```

### **Before Releases**
```bash
# Full validation including resilience
./run-tests.sh extreme

## ðŸŒŸ **Pro Tips**

### **Performance Optimization**
- Use `./run-tests.sh quick` during active development
- Run `./run-tests.sh standard` before committing
- Use `npm run test:load:smoke` for quick performance checks
- Reserve `./run-tests.sh extreme` for release validation

### **Debugging Failed Tests**
```bash
# Verbose output for specific components
composer run test:api:verbose
npm run playwright:debug
npm run playwright:headed
```

### **Environment Configuration**
```bash
# Set environment variables for different targets
export DMN_TEST_URL="https://your-test-site.com"
export DMN_API_KEY="your-api-key"
export TEST_ENV="development"  # or staging, production
```

### **Parallel Execution**
- Most test commands support parallel execution
- Playwright automatically runs cross-browser tests in parallel
- K6 load tests simulate concurrent users
