## üåü **Pro Tips for Enhanced Testing**

### **Performance Optimization**
- Use `npm run cypress:dish-form` during active development (fastest)
- Use `npm run test:e2e:dish-form` before committing (comprehensive)
- Use `npm run playwright:dish-form` for cross-browser validation
- Use `npm run test:e2e:dish-form:live` for live environment testing
- Reserve `./run-tests.sh extreme` for release validation

### **Debugging Form Issues**
```bash
# Visual debugging
npm run cypress:open               # See forms in real-time
npm run playwright:dish-form:headed # Watch cross-browser behavior
npm run playwright:dish-form:ui    # Modern debugging interface

# Specific component debugging
npm run cypress:dish-form           # Debug dish form workflow only
npm run cypress:dmn-api             # Debug DMN API integration only
npm run playwright:dish-form:debug  # Step-by-step dish form debugging

# Verbose output for specific components
composer run test:api:verbose      # ‚ú® Detailed OpenAPI validation output
npm run playwright:debug           # Step-by-step debugging all tests
npm run playwright:specific-test   # Debug specific test line
```

### **Environment Configuration**
```bash
# Set environment variables for different targets
export DMN_TEST_URL="https://your-test-site.com"
export DMN_API_KEY="your-api-key"
export TEST_ENV="development"  # or staging, production

# For live testing
npm run cypress:live               # Uses configured live URL
```

### **Enhanced Testing Best Practices**
- **Cypress for development**: Fast feedback, visual debugging (`npm run cypress:dish-form`)
- **Playwright for CI/CD**: Cross-browser reliability (`npm run playwright:dish-form`)
- **Both for releases**: Maximum confidence (`npm run test:e2e:dish-form`)
- **Live testing**: Always test against real environment before deployment (`npm run test:e2e:dish-form:live`)
- **Specific testing**: Use targeted commands for faster feedback (`npm run cypress:dmn-api`)
- **Visual debugging**: Use headed modes to see form interactions (`npm run playwright:dish-form:headed`)
- **‚ú® API validation**: Use `composer run test:api:verbose` for detailed OpenAPI validation
